## Working With Files

1. Write a perl program that takes a file name as input, if the file is a program - execute it, otherwise prints its contents

2. Write a perl program that "remembers" how many times it was called. On the first run it creates a new file called "count.bin" and writes 0 to it.
Subsequent runs should update the file and print 1, 2, 3, etc.

3. Write a perl program that reads an input file for IP addresses and tries to ping each address.
Input file format:

		google 212.179.180.95
		walla 212.25.69.162

		bad 1.1.1.1


4. Read a list of directory names from a file "input.txt" and create a new directory for each line in the file.
Sample input.txt:
		foo
		bar
		buz
		music/songs


5. Write a perl program that takes a directory name as parameter and:

  - prints every sub directory that has more than 10 .pl files in it
  - prints total size of all .pl files in that directory
  - delete all empty subdirectories
